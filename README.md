# social-network

## Description
This project creates an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. At this time there is no front end to see the magic happen so Insomnia was used to test and ensure routes are working correctly.

## Technology Used
* express  
* mongoDB  
* Insomnia for testing
